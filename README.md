## ⚠️ Signed builds will be available soon, for now you can build and run the app locally

---

## 🚀 How to run the app from source

- 🟩 Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (v20 or later)

- 🏃 Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (a better alternative to npm)

- ⬇️ Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

- 📚 Run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies

- 👨‍🔬 Run `pnpm dev` to start the app in development mode

- 🛠️ Alternatively, you can run `pnpm build:win`, `pnpm build:mac`, or `pnpm build:linux` to build the app for your platform

- 🔎 The built app will be available in the `dist` directory

We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the included recommended extensions for the best development experience 💪
